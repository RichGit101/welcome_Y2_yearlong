## Welcome to Y2 Yearlong!! 
Your one-stop shop for all Y2 yearlong materials [2016-2017]
# Syllabus

This is the syllabus for the yearlong.  Each row represents a week of the program.  I highly encourage you to go through the resources <b>before</b> class but the materials should help you understand the material covered in class more in depth.  

* __Week:__ The week (from Sunday to Saturday) of the yearlong meeting
* __Resources:__ These resources will provide you greater information about the topics covered.  If you missed a lecture or need to refer back to anything covered, here is where you should start. 
* __Repo:__ The repo contains the day's exercises as well as lecture notes and slides.  These notes and slides will also be available on Google Drive.
