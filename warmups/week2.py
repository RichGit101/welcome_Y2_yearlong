    Find the first occurence of the character char and return the string with
    everything before char moved to the end of the string. If char doesn't
    appear, return the same string.
    
    Example:
    >>> shift_on_character("elephant", "p")
    'phantele'
    '''
    pass  #remove this line and add a return statement when you are finished
