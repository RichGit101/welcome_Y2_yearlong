'''
You've built an in-flight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.
Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal less than the flight length.

Write a function that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and a list of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a list of tuples containing movie pairs the flight attendents can show along with the total time the movies will take to run. 

When building your function:

-Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
-Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
-Optimize for runtime over memory (extra credit)
