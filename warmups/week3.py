def count_characters(string):
    '''
    INPUT: STRING
    OUTPUT: DICT (STRING => INT)

    Return a dictionary which contains a count of the number of times each
    character appears in the string, case-insensitive ("A" and "a" should be treated as the same character).
    Characters which would have a count of 0 should not need to be included in
    your dictionary.
    
    Example:  count_characters("Good Morning")
              >>>{'g':3, 'o':3, 'd': 1, "m":1, "r":1, "n":2, "i":1}
    
    '''
    pass
